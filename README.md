# Real-Time Chat Application with Rock, Paper, Scissors Game
## Overview
This Python socket-based application provides users with a real time chat experience and incorporates a rock, paper, scissors game. The application follows a client-server architecture, and communication between clients and the server is facilitated using Python's socket module.

## Technologies Used
Python (socket module):
The backend of the application is developed using Python's socket module to enable communication between clients and the server.
##How it Works
Client-Server Architecture:

The application follows a client-server architecture, utilizing the principles of socket communication.
Real-Time Chat:

Clients can exchange messages with each other through the server in real-time, providing insights into networking principles.
Rock, Paper, Scissors Game:

The application includes a game feature where clients and the server take turns making moves in the classic rock, paper, scissors game.

## Main Goal
